We developed this code to train our improvised architecture of Visual Attention Model.

One can run this code by importing project to Codeblocks IDE and linking to opencv libraries in settings of codeblocks IDE for project..

Hint to run on ubuntu:[In Ubuntu one can use debian package manager "dpkg" cli tool to gove the path to opencv libraries] 

To understand the Visual Attention model, please have a glance at our published paper:
